**Project Introduction**

CHILI CHILL is a funky, fun, and energetic fast-food brand that delights customers with a diverse array of food, snacks, and drinks. This entire project was independently completed by me. I meticulously designed and hand-drew their distinctive LOGO, creating various whimsical versions of our brand mascot to embody the brand's lively spirit.

In terms of color, I selected light red as the primary brand color, embodying energy and dynamism. Complementing this, I incorporated blue as a secondary color, forming a visual contrast that conveys a sense of chill and relaxation. This color combination captures the essence of Chili Chill's playful and laid-back vibe, ensuring a memorable and enjoyable customer experience.
